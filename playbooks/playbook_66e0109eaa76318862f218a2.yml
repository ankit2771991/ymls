            The main difference between "{{ shell_path1 }}/bash" and "{{ shell_path2 }}/bash" is that
            using "{{ shell_path1 }}" allows the script to search for the appropriate bash interpreter
            based on the user's environment, whereas "{{ shell_path2 }}" specifies the exact path to the
            bash interpreter on the system.
